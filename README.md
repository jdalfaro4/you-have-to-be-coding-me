# John's Personal Portfolio

## Description

This portfolio exemplifies almost everything you can know about me. You can find previous work I have deployed, whimsical color schemes, favorite movie references, and much more.

This project was extremly unique in that the CSS proved to be most difficult for my current skill level, however with determination and focus, I was able to modify the webpage to fit my character and required information as planned.
