                <p class="aboutmepara">I'm high spirited, very inquisitive and love being around people. I've worked with people in many ways throughout
                    my life, from instructing them how to dance Zumba routines, to solving their administrative needs in Apple Developer Program Support.
                    I have also worked to help people find the lowest prices for the best coverages in the world of
                    Auto Insurance. Helping people is in my nature, and I know that this will translate wonderfully in the world 
                    of full stack web development in creating the best applications to solve their everyday needs.
